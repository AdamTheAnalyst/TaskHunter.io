# TaskHunter.io

This project is an exploration into developing a small SaaS base application in an Open Source manner. 

The code is completely free to download, edit, modify and fix. A hosted version can be found at www.TaskHunter.io

# Background

I think about task lists in my head as RAM, i can keep a certain amount in memory, but at some point i have to cache stuff to disk (Bullet Journal) and then re-load them into my head when i need them. There are millions of task planners out there, many with thousands of features i just didnt need. So i created TaskHunter as a way to quickly jot down open tasks against me.

At the time of publishing, it was my first attempt at learning Vue.js, so the UI design is pretty primitive, but i will clean it up over time.

I also have been wondering what it would be like to try and run a SaaS app, but completely open source, for now i doubt anyone will contribute, but if you by some quirk of fate, find TaskHunter.io and want to add to it, fix things or change things, please raise me a pull request and I will aim to automate re-deploys on a daily basis.
